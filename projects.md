Some things that I have created or have helped to create.

## Maps

<figure class="third">
  <a href="http://nychenge.com/" title="NYCHenge: Interactive map to find beautiful sunsets in New York City"><img src="/images/work-samples/nychenge.png"></a>
  <a title="A digital tour of one of NYC most anticipated open data additions" href="http://andrewxhill.github.io/cartodb-examples/scroll-story/pluto/index.html"><img src="/images/work-samples/plutotour.png"></a>
  <a href="http://andrewxhill.github.io/cartodb-examples/scroll-story/basic/index.html" title="A map story built using historical data from the NYPL"><img src="/images/work-samples/nypl-story.png"></a>
  <figcaption>Making maps is something I get to do both for work and for fun. I enjoy thinking about using the map as a storytelling tool and often create prototypes to explore that idea. Here are a couple mapping projects I have created recently.</figcaption>

## Code & Data

<figure class="third">
  <a href="http://www.vizzuality.com/projects/gfwprototype" title="Global Forest Watch"><img src="/images/work-samples/gfw.png"></a>
  <a href="http://cartodb.github.io/torque/" title="Prototype development of the Torque library"><img src="/images/work-samples/torque-lib.png"></a>
  <a title="Nokia HERE: Living Cities" href="http://here.com/livingcities/"><img src="/images/work-samples/livingcities.png"></a>
  <figcaption>I write code and I do a bit of data science. In the above projects I did a little bit of both, mostly exploring how to map big data on the web, these are a mix of data science and data visualization.</figcaption>

## Speaking
