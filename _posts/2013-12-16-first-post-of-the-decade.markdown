## It's been a while

I've been meaning to get back into blogging for quite some time now. The last time I had my own blog was back in 2006. It was a blog I kept as part of an undergraduate research project. The blog, called Guiology, is now gone, forever lost save perhaps some cached versions here or there. The site was meant to deliver details about my exploration of the interface between information design, biology, and data exploration. A big part of that project was some early research I was doing to visualize the spread of influenza using Google Earth. The image on the right was a screenshot first published on the blog, you can still see an early post about it over on [Ogle Earth](http://ogleearth.com/2006/05/google-earth-geospatial-tree-map-alternative/).

The site was taken down because we ended up moving a lot of the work to a published paper. I'm not sure why we chose that workflow, but in the end, that's just the way it is. It is a shame though because looking back it would be nice to have a blog to help understand how I got here from there :)

Since that time I've [written](http://blog.vizzuality.com/) [so](http://blog.notesfromnature.org/2013/07/01/stats_first_look/) [many](http://mappinglife.wordpress.com/2011/04/) [blog](http://okcon.org/2013/08/30/okcon-2013-guest-post-using-cartodb-in-open-data/) [posts](http://blog.cartodb.com/), but always as part of a collaborative project, never just my own. Now, at the urging of a few people ([eightysteele](http://twitter.com/eightysteele) in particular) I've finally gotten around to putting up my own site with my own blog. I guess the only thing that remains is to figure out if I have anything interesting to say.
