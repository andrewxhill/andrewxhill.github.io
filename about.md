Andrew is thinker and tinkerer living in Brooklyn. He works at [Vizzuality](http://vizzuality.com) and [CartoDB](http://cartodb.com) where he thinks about the future of maps. He has an obsession with storytelling, give him a few beers and you'll have a hard time getting him to shut-up. He also tries to apply that interest to data science, thinking about how we can communicate and explore data better through the use of storytelling. In his current position, he can regularly be found trying to create interesting maps online or giving workshops and presentations, often in New York City. Andrew is originally from New Hampshire, received his PhD in Biology at the University of Colorado, Boulder, and has lived in New York since 2011.
